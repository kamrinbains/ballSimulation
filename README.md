# ballSimulation

A quick python project of a simulation of multiple bouncing balls. 
There are 4 different colored balls that each have a standard of 15 lives and are in a boundary of a larger outer ring.
Each time they collide they lose a life.
They are displayed on a leaderboard of which survive.
They spawn randomly in the bounds of the ring and with a random velocity.

1) setup your python environment
2) pip install pygame
3) run the simulation
