# ballSimulation

A quick python project of a simulation of multiple bouncing balls
There are 4 different colored balls that each have a standard of 15 lives and are in a boundary of a larger outer ring
Each time they collide they lose a life
They are displayed on a leaderboard of which survive
They spawn randomly in the bounds of the ring and with a random velocity

setup your python environment
pip install pygames
run the simulation
